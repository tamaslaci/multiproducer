## Multiproducer project
> Study project for my 'Andvanced JAVA' course at the University,
> practicing the concepts of Lambdas, Streams and Generics.

The code of the project consists of JAVA lambda functions using functional interfaces,
like `Supplier`, `Function`, `BiFunction` and basic collections like `List`, `LinkedList`,
and also using streams, for example `IntStream`.
The functions are not connected to a UI or produce any console output independently,
but the operation and correctness of the elements of the task are tested with the JUnit5 framework.
